orbs:
  # The Node.js orb contains a set of prepackaged CircleCI configuration you can utilize
  # Orbs reduce the amount of configuration required for common tasks. 
  # See the orb documentation here: https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/node
  node: circleci/node@4.1


jobs:
  # Below is the definition of your job to build and test your app, you can rename and customize it as you want.
  build-and-test:  
    # These next lines define a docker executor: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/
    # You can specify an image from Dockerhub or use one of our Convenience Images from CircleCI's Developer Hub.
    # A list of available CircleCI docker Convenience Images are available here: https://circleci.com/developer/images/image/cimg/node
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:15.1
    # Then run your tests!
    # CircleCI will report the results back to your VCS provider.
    steps:
      # Checkout the code as the first step.
      - checkout
      # Next, the node orb's install-packages step will install the dependencies from a package.json.
      # The orb install-packages step will also automatically cache them for faster future runs.

workflows:
  # Below is the definition of your workflow.
  # Inside the workflow, you provide the jobs you want to run, e.g this workflow runs the build-and-test job above.
  # CircleCI will run this workflow on every commit.
  # For more details on extending your workflow, see the configuration docs: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#workflows
  sample: 
    jobs:
      - build-and-test
      # For running simple node tests, you could optionally use the node/test job from the orb to replicate and replace the job above in fewer lines.
      # - node/test
